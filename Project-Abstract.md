This project mainly focuses on the Astrophysics aspect of Science, contrary to the other projects offered by the club during Summers 2023, which are computational and based on hands-on experience. 
This project aims to ensure that students get enthusiastic in the field of Astronomy by applying concepts of Physics and understanding and analyzing raw data of official resources like NASA and ISRO and understanding the fate of stars through this Summer project. 
This project will also include the usage of the Observatory located in the Flight Laboratory to give the students an experience of locating star structures and learning Image processing as a collab with the other summer projects offered by the club. 
The projectâ€™s theme is the life cycle of a star and its entire fate, considering various classifications. 
This project mainly expects students who are deeply interested in Science and want to pursue research in the future. 
They will definitely have exposure to research, meeting deadlines, interacting with mentors and mentees by discussing Science of the Universe, and actually applying them (using the Observatory).
